## [0.1.11] - 2025-09-24

### Changed
- **Credit Granting Logic Refactor**: Simplified and clarified credit granting behavior
  - First-time users always receive `invitation_grant` (5 credits) on registration day
  - Referred users receive `invitation_grant` (5) + `referral` bonus (3) = 8 credits total
  - Daily grants (`daily_grant`) only given on subsequent days, not on registration day
  - This provides clearer semantics: invitation_grant for joining, daily_grant for returning

## [0.1.10] - 2025-09-24

### Fixed
- **Credit Double-Granting Bug**: Fixed referred users incorrectly receiving invitation credits
  - Referred users were getting 11 credits (3 referral + 3 daily + 5 invitation) instead of 8
  - Now correctly receive 8 credits total: 5 initial credits + 3 referral bonus
  - Prevents invitation credits from being granted to users who were referred
  - Referred users get a boosted initial credit amount (5 instead of 3) as an extra incentive

## [0.1.9] - 2025-09-24

### Fixed

  - Logs referral link generation in share function
  - Helps identify when/why referral code might be missing

## [0.1.6] - 2025-09-23

### Fixed
- **Share Link Missing**: Fixed issue where the referral link was missing from shared content
  - Reverted to using separate title, text, and URL fields for native share API
  - Ensures compatibility across all platforms and apps
  - URL is passed separately to ensure it's always included
  - Fallback methods still combine text and link

## [0.1.5] - 2025-09-23

### Fixed
- **Share Message Duplication**: Fixed duplicate URLs in shared content
  - Combined title and text into single message
  - Native share API now only receives text field to prevent URL extraction
