# Bot Detection Implementation

## Overview

Bot detection prevents automation tools, crawlers, and monitoring services from creating fake user records and consuming credits. This keeps analytics clean and prevents system abuse.

## Implementation (KISS Approach)

We use the industry-standard **`isbot`** library for user-agent based bot detection. Bots receive a normal 200 response but no database records are created.

## What Gets Blocked

### ✅ Automatically Detected and Blocked:

- **Screenshot/Preview Tools**: Vercel, Netlify, social media preview bots
- **Search Engine Crawlers**: Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.
- **Monitoring Services**: UptimeRobot, Pingdom, etc.
- **Headless Browsers**: HeadlessChrome, Puppeteer
- **Social Media Bots**: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn crawlers
- **No User-Agent**: Requests without user-agent header

### ✅ Not Blocked (Legitimate Users):

- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (all versions)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, etc.)
- All legitimate user traffic

## Where It's Applied

Bot detection is applied at **2 key endpoints**:

1. **`/api/v1/me`** - Legacy API endpoint
2. **`/api/public/user`** - Public API endpoint

Both endpoints check for bots **before** any database operations occur.

## How It Works

### 1. Detection
```typescript
import { shouldBlockBot } from '@/lib/security/botDetection';

const userAgent = request.headers.get('user-agent');
if (shouldBlockBot(userAgent)) {
  // Bot detected!
}
```

### 2. Response Strategy
When a bot is detected:
- ✅ Return HTTP 200 (success)
- ✅ Return valid-looking JSON response
- ❌ Don't create fingerprint records
- ❌ Don't grant credits
- ❌ Don't create leads
- ❌ Don't log activity

### 3. Mock Response
Bots receive a response that looks normal:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "fingerprint": "bot_fingerprint",
    "credits": 0,
    "usage": 0,
    "referralCode": null,
    "creditsPaused": false,
    "branding": { ... }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Clean Analytics**: No bot traffic polluting your user metrics
2. **Cost Savings**: No credits wasted on bots
3. **Database Efficiency**: Fewer fake records
4. **Silent Operation**: Bots don't know they're being blocked
5. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box for all apps

## Testing

Tested and verified to detect:
- ✅ Vercel screenshot tools
- ✅ Vercel edge functions
- ✅ Major search engine crawlers
- ✅ Social media bots
- ✅ Monitoring services
- ✅ Headless browsers
- ✅ Empty/missing user-agents

All legitimate browsers correctly identified as human traffic.

## Technical Details

### Library Used
- **`isbot`** - 50k+ weekly downloads
- Actively maintained with regular updates
- Comprehensive bot signature database
- Used by major platforms and CDNs

### File Locations
- **Utility**: `/src/lib/security/botDetection.ts`
- **Applied in**: 
  - `/src/app/api/v1/me/route.ts`
  - `/src/app/api/public/user/route.ts`

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal**: User-agent string check is extremely fast (~0.1ms)
- **No Network Calls**: Pure string matching
- **No Database Queries**: Happens before any DB operations

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If needed, we could add:
- Behavioral analysis (mouse movements, timing patterns)
- Fingerprint quality scoring
- Machine learning-based detection
- Per-app allowlists/blocklists

But for now, the KISS approach with `isbot` provides excellent results with minimal complexity.

## Examples

### Vercel Screenshot Bot
```
User-Agent: vercel-screenshot
Result: ✅ Blocked
```

### Legitimate Chrome User
```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Result: ✅ Allowed (normal flow)
```

### Monitoring Service
```
User-Agent: UptimeRobot/2.0
Result: ✅ Blocked
```

## Configuration

**None required!** Bot detection is automatically enabled for all apps and all endpoints. No configuration, no opt-in, no complexity.
