## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Start with Phase 1-3 for core functionality âœ…
2. Phase 5 (SDK) can be developed in parallel with Phase 4 âœ…
3. Phase 6-7 can be added incrementally âœ… (6 done, 7 partial)
4. Phase 8 for production deployment
5. Phase 9-10 for polish and maintenance
6. **Phase 11 (Enhanced Waitlist) after core system is stable and deployed**
7. **Phase 12 (USD Tracking & Secure Invitations) - High priority security & analytics enhancements**

### Key Decisions Made
- [x] Use bcrypt for API key hashing (better Vercel compatibility, simpler deployment)
- [x] Use Resend as email provider (RESEND_API_KEY configured)
- [ ] Use Free Redis provider tier (Upstash free tier initially)
- [ ] Determine if multi-tenant support is needed initially: basic

### Phase 12 Technical Decisions
- **USD Tracking**: Optional per-app feature, stored as decimal with 2 decimal places
- **Invitation Codes**: Use nanoid for generation, 8-character codes with "INV-" prefix
- **Code Security**: One-time use by default, fingerprint-locked after first use
- **Code Expiration**: Default 7 days, configurable per app
- **Backward Compatibility**: All new features are optional and won't break existing integrations

### Simplifications for MVP
- Keep Tenant model but make tenantId nullable initially (single-tenant mode)
- Start with basic email templates (no fancy HTML)
- Use simple HMAC tokens instead of JWT
- Skip Cloudflare Turnstile initially
- EventLog can be minimal (just store key events)
- Admin dashboard with basic auth (no complex auth system)
