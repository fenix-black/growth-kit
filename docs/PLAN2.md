# GrowthKit Phase 2: Enhanced Waitlist & Auto-Invitation System

## Overview
Transform the waitlist from a simple gate into a viral growth engine with automated invitations, master referral codes, and comprehensive tracking.

**ðŸ”‘ Important: All features are PER-APP**
- Each app has its own independent waitlist
- Each app has its own configuration and quotas
- Each app has its own master referral code
- Each app tracks its own analytics separately
- Users can be on multiple app waitlists simultaneously

## Phase 1: Waitlist Gating Foundation

  - [x] `masterReferralCode` (string, unique per app)
  - [x] `masterReferralCredits` (integer)
- [x] Add invitation tracking fields to Waitlist model
  - [x] `invitedVia` (enum: 'manual' | 'auto' | 'master_referral')
  - [x] `invitationEmail` (string, optional)
  - [x] `convertedAt` (datetime, optional)
- [x] Create migration for new fields

### 1.2 API Updates for Waitlist Status
- [x] Update `/v1/me` endpoint response
  - [x] Add `waitlist` object to response (per app context)
  - [x] Include `enabled`, `status`, `position`, `requiresWaitlist`
  - [x] Check if user should see waitlist based on app's settings
- [x] Update user creation logic
  - [x] If app's waitlist enabled and no referral â†’ require waitlist
  - [x] If has referral claim â†’ bypass app's waitlist
  - [x] If invited to this app (status = 'invited') â†’ grant access

### 1.3 Master Referral Code System
- [x] Update `/v1/referral/exchange` endpoint
  - [x] Recognize master referral codes
  - [x] Return special claim token for master codes
- [x] Update `/v1/me` referral processing
  - [x] Handle master referral claims
  - [x] Grant configured credits without referrer

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Path** (Do First)
   - Database schema updates
   - `/v1/me` endpoint updates
   - Hook waitlist state
   - Basic waitlist configuration UI

2. **Core Features** (Do Second)
   - Master referral code system
   - Auto-invitation cron job
   - Email templates
   - Waitlist management UI

3. **Polish** (Do Third)
   - Analytics dashboard
   - Gate component
   - Documentation
   - Testing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Waitlist â†’ Active conversion rate > 50%
- [ ] Invited users refer at least 1 person (avg)
- [ ] Zero manual invitation work for admins
- [ ] < 100ms added latency for waitlist check

## Technical Decisions

- **Master code credits**: System grants them (no source tracking)
- **Invitation tracking**: Store in Waitlist model with `invitedVia` field
- **Cron timing**: Single daily batch initially (can enhance later)
- **Email provider**: Resend (already configured)
- **Gate logic**: Client-side in hook (not middleware)

## Data Isolation & Multi-Tenancy

**Critical**: All operations are scoped by appId
- Waitlist entries: `WHERE appId = ?`
- Master codes: Unique per app, stored in App model
- Invitations: Processed per app with app-specific quotas
- Analytics: Aggregated per app, never across apps
- User can be on waitlist for App A while active in App B
- Referral codes are app-specific (already implemented)
- Credits are per user per app (via fingerprint + appId)

## Environment Variables Needed

```env
# Cron authentication (Vercel)
CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret

# Email configuration (already have RESEND_API_KEY)
INVITATION_FROM_EMAIL=invites@yourdomain.com
INVITATION_FROM_NAME=YourApp Team
```

## Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1-2: 2 days (Foundation + SDK)
- Phase 3: 1 day (Admin UI)
- Phase 4: 1 day (Auto-invitations)
- Phase 5: 1 day (Analytics)
- Phase 6: 1 day (Testing & Docs)

**Total: ~6 days for full implementation**

## Notes

- Master referral codes bypass waitlist just like regular referrals
- Invited users start with credits to reduce friction
- Waitlist position is preserved even after invitation
- System tracks conversion to measure invitation effectiveness
- Future: Could add "invite friends to skip the line" feature
