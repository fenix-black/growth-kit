# GrowthKit Phase 2: Enhanced Waitlist & Auto-Invitation System

## Overview
Transform the waitlist from a simple gate into a viral growth engine with automated invitations, master referral codes, and comprehensive tracking.

**ðŸ“Œ Note**: Phase 12 in [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md) adds critical security and analytics enhancements to this system:
- Unique invitation codes to prevent sharing abuse
- USD value tracking for ROI measurement
- Enhanced security with fingerprint-locked codes

**ðŸ”‘ Important: All features are PER-APP**
- Each app has its own independent waitlist
- Each app has its own configuration and quotas
- Each app has its own master referral code
- Each app tracks its own analytics separately
- Users can be on multiple app waitlists simultaneously

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical Path** (Do First)
   - Database schema updates
   - `/v1/me` endpoint updates
   - Hook waitlist state
   - Basic waitlist configuration UI

2. **Core Features** (Do Second)
   - Master referral code system
   - Auto-invitation cron job
   - Email templates
   - Waitlist management UI

3. **Security & Analytics** (Integrate with Phase 12)
   - Unique invitation codes (Phase 12.2)
   - USD tracking in analytics (Phase 12.1)
   - Code redemption flow (Phase 12.2)
   - Enhanced invitation emails with codes

4. **Polish** (Do Last)
   - Analytics dashboard with USD metrics
   - Gate component
   - Documentation
   - Testing

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Waitlist â†’ Active conversion rate > 50%
- [ ] Invited users refer at least 1 person (avg)
- [ ] Zero manual invitation work for admins
- [ ] < 100ms added latency for waitlist check

## Technical Decisions

- **Master code credits**: System grants them (no source tracking)
- **Invitation tracking**: Store in Waitlist model with `invitedVia` field
- **Cron timing**: Single daily batch initially (can enhance later)
- **Email provider**: Resend (already configured)
- **Gate logic**: Client-side in hook (not middleware)
- **[Phase 12] Unique invitation codes**: 8-char codes with "INV-" prefix, one-time use
- **[Phase 12] Code security**: Fingerprint-locked after first use, 7-day expiration
- **[Phase 12] USD tracking**: Optional per-app, stored in Usage model

## Data Isolation & Multi-Tenancy

**Critical**: All operations are scoped by appId
- Waitlist entries: `WHERE appId = ?`
- Master codes: Unique per app, stored in App model
- Invitations: Processed per app with app-specific quotas
- Analytics: Aggregated per app, never across apps
- User can be on waitlist for App A while active in App B
- Referral codes are app-specific (already implemented)
- Credits are per user per app (via fingerprint + appId)

## Environment Variables Needed

```env
# Cron authentication (Vercel)
CRON_SECRET=your-cron-secret

# Email configuration (already have RESEND_API_KEY)
INVITATION_FROM_EMAIL=invites@yourdomain.com
INVITATION_FROM_NAME=YourApp Team
```

## Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1-2: 2 days (Foundation + SDK)
- Phase 3: 1 day (Admin UI)
- Phase 4: 1 day (Auto-invitations)
- Phase 5: 1 day (Analytics)
- Phase 6: 1 day (Testing & Docs)

**Total: ~6 days for full implementation**

## Notes

- Master referral codes bypass waitlist just like regular referrals
- Invited users start with credits to reduce friction
- Waitlist position is preserved even after invitation
- System tracks conversion to measure invitation effectiveness
- Future: Could add "invite friends to skip the line" feature
- **[Phase 12 Enhancement]**: Unique invitation codes prevent sharing and improve security
- **[Phase 12 Enhancement]**: USD tracking enables ROI measurement for viral features
