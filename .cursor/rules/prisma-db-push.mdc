# Prisma Database Operations

## Always Use `prisma db push`

This project uses a **single database environment** and does NOT use migration files.

### ✅ Correct Command
```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### ❌ Never Use
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Why `db push`?
- **Single database**: We only have one database (no separate dev/staging/prod)
- **No migration history needed**: We don't need to track migration files
- **Faster development**: Direct schema sync without migration file generation
- **Simpler workflow**: No shadow database issues or migration conflicts

### When Making Schema Changes
1. Edit [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma)
2. Run `npx prisma db push` to sync changes
3. Prisma Client is automatically regenerated

### Database Reset (if needed)
```bash
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

This rule applies to all Prisma-related database operations in this codebase.
